genral Management Information System (通用管理信息系统)

It is a general Management Information System based on -GWA2 and configurable I/O.

“In a demand-driven opinion, we faced increasing requests of creating enormous table-based management tools for operation teams in years of 2005-2010 at ChinaM, an affiliate of Telstra  in Beijing. 

Those shared some common functions and most of them just needed to achieve basic goals (CURDLS) for a table. So we conducted many practices to find one to meet this kind of demand, for all, forever.”
